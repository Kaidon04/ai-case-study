# AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* The company I am doing my ai case study on is Tempo

* This company was founded in 2015

* The two founders of the company are Moawia Eldeeb and Josh Augustin

* <p> The founder Moawia Eldeeb at age 12 lived in a homeless shelter.

Personal trainers from YMCA trained him durint this time-frame.

They did this in exchange of Moawia staying in school.

From this time he built his confidence and discipline through training.

This caused him to have a passion for the power of training and how to implement cost effective systems for training.

So he teamed up with Josh Augustin to provide a new at-home workout system powered by AI. </p>

* With 12 investors they have raised 298.97 Million dollars for their company.

## Buisness Activities

* Their intended market is people looking to improve strength and overall health from home.

* Tempo uses 3D sensors for feedback on your exercises in your own home to provide proffesional help in the comfort of your own home.

Then with integrated AI it will use that information to prescribe changes to your workout to improve and challenge you. </p>
