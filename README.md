# AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

- The company I am doing my AI case study on is Tempo.
- Founded in 2015 by Moawia Eldeeb and Josh Augustin.
- Moawia Eldeeb, inspired by his personal experience training at the YMCA while living in a homeless shelter, developed a passion for making professional training more accessible. This led to the creation of Tempo, an AI-powered at-home workout system.
- Tempo has raised $316.3 million from 12 investors.

## Business Activities

- Tempo is solving the lack of personalization and efficiency in home workouts.
- Target market: Individuals looking to improve strength and health from home.
- **How AI is used**: Tempo’s 3D time-of-flight (ToF) sensor tracks user movements, form, speed, and weight to provide personalized feedback and workout adjustments.
- Pricing: Tempo Studio starts at $2,495, with a $39 monthly membership for AI-powered training [oai_citation:6,Tempo Raises $220M in New Capital to Enhance AI & 3D Sensor Technology | Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210413005688/en/Tempo-Raises-220M-in-New-Capital-to-Enhance-AI-3D-Sensor-Technology).

## Recommendations

- I recommend integrating a built-in cable system like Tonal’s for additional workout versatility.
- Adding a pulley system connected to the AI platform could enhance weight, speed, and motion analysis, further personalizing workout experiences.
