# AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* The company I am doing my ai case study on is Tempo

* This company was founded in 2015

* The two founders of the company are Moawia Eldeeb and Josh Augustin

* The founder Moawia Eldeeb at age 12 lived in a homeless shelter.

Personal trainers from YMCA trained him durint this time-frame.

They did this in exchange of Moawia staying in school.

From this time he built his confidence and discipline through training.

This caused him to have a passion for the power of training and how to implement cost effective systems for training. 

So he teamed up with Josh Augustin to provide a new at-home workout system powered by AI.

* With 12 investors they have raised 298.97 Million dollars for their company.

## Buisness Activities
