# AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* The company I am doing my ai case study on is Tempo

* This company was founded in 2015

* The two founders of the company are Moawia Eldeeb and Josh Augustin

* <p> The founder Moawia Eldeeb at age 12 lived in a homeless shelter.

Personal trainers from YMCA trained him durint this time-frame.

They did this in exchange of Moawia staying in school.

From this time he built his confidence and discipline through training.

This caused him to have a passion for the power of training and how to implement cost effective systems for training.

So he teamed up with Josh Augustin to provide a new at-home workout system powered by AI. </p>

* With 12 investors they have raised 298.97 Million dollars for their company.

## Buisness Activities

* They are trying to solve for the lack of personalization and effeciency that comes with home workouts. 

* Their intended market is people looking to improve strength and overall health from home.

* Tempo uses 3D sensors for feedback on your exercises in your own home to provide proffesional help in the comfort of your own home. 

* <p> Tempo uses their 3D time of flight(Tof) sensor to observe your form, speed, weight, and distance.

Then with integrated AI it will use that information to prescribe changes to your workout to improve and challenge you. </p>


## Landscape

* This company is integrating AI into the fitness industry; specifically the connected fitness equipment industry. 

* <p> One huge innovation and trend in connected fitness is the use of wearable devices; like fitbits, apple watches, and etc.

Another huge innovation was the implementation of AI for fitness coaching. </p>

* Other major companies in this field are EGYM, FORME, and Tonal.

## Results 

* Tempo has made quite the impact on the industry and is shown by them easily securing $220 million in investments. 

* Core metrics companies use to measure success would be profit, members, and cost effeciency. 

* Tempo is successful in these metrics with it being very cost effecient with it being $395 with a $39 monthly subscription, compared to tonal which is $4,000.



## Recommendations 

* I would reccomend a built in system for cables into the main body for the device like Tonal.

* I think it would really benefit the company because cable exercises have a lot of benefits that free-weight exercises dont have.

* It would simply just need to add a pully system into the main body and connect it to the system to analyze the weight, speed, and motion.
